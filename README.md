### Description
For my Assignment I took inspiration from the OOP lab test of 2016,the DeLorean car from Back to the Future and star wars. Like in back to the future the car must reach 88 miles per hour in order to jump back in time, however in this case it incorporated hyperspeed as seen in star wars and other science fiction adaptations.
I used classes to separate the functionality of the program and made calls to them in the main class in order to avoid a mess and coagulation of code.
I tried to incorporate sound however it failed and I decided to ultimately leave it out. I decided to use a different font to the default processing one to give it a sort of space feel. Since I took inspiration from DeLorean I felt it necessary to include the logo in the bottom dashboard of the program.
